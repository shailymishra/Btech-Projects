## SimpleSpellChecker
Implement spell check using Trie Tree as 3 semester project of subject Data Structures. Coded in java. The folder contains all the details - Codes and report

## CPU_Scheduliing_algorithms
This was done in semester 5 as a part of operating system course. 
I have implemented First Come First Serve (FCFS)  and Round Robin (RR) algorithms for CPU scheduling. The program for a particular  algorithm takes file containing arithmetic expressions as processes, parses those  expressions to scheduler and calculates results. Based on algorithm specified, these  results are displayed on terminal as well as are stored in a separate file with file name  from which expression was taken, arrival time and time taken to execute the expression. In order to implement scheduler, we have used pthread and signal handling.
